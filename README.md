# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Cross-Modality Retinal Vessel Segmentation via Disentangling Representation Style Transfer and Collaborative Consistency Learning

Pytorch implementation for our unsupervised domain adaptation framework with application to retinal vessel segmentation. We use style transfer and collaborative consistency learning to train a segmentation model on the target domain.
